  abstract =	"Proposed by Tibshirani (1996), the LASSO (least
		 absolute shrinkage and selection operator) estimates a
		 vector of regression coe#cients by minimising the
		 residual sum of squares subject to a constraint on the
		 l 1 -norm of coe#cient vector. The LASSO estimator
		 typically has one or more zero elements and thus shares
		 characteristics of both shrinkage estimation and
		 variable selection. In this paper we treat the LASSO as
		 a convex programming problem and derive its dual.
		 Consideration of the primal and dual problems together
		 leads to important new insights into the
		 characteristics of the LASSO estimator and to an
		 improved method for estimating its covariance matrix.
		 Using these results we also develop an e#cient
		 algorithm for computing LASSO estimates which is usable
		 even in cases where the number of regressors exceeds
		 the number of observations. KEY WORDS AND PHRASES.

		 Squares, Quadratic Programming, Penalised Regression,
